# STACKS add-on for Blender
Here is supposed to be a readme, but I'm running out of time to fill it. Maybe later. This is add-on for compbining stacks from mesh operators in Blender, install it through Blender > Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install, enable checkbox near its name after install and find it in N-panel in the Stacks tab.
